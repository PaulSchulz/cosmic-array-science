* Introduction
This repository contains the data and interactive Python (ipython)
scripts used to process data from a Cosmic Array detector.

https://hackaday.io/project/16568-cosmic-array

** Quick Start
#+BEGIN_SRC 
./scripts/get-data
# Check that data has been successfuly retrieved.
cp cosmic-array.log* data/
./scripts/merge-data
./scripts/clean-data
#+END_SRC

** Details


It is using a Jupyter Notebook to process and graph the detector events.

[[file:plot-muon-counts.png][file:plot-muon-counts.png]]

Once the Jupyter Notebook has been installed, it can be run using:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  jupyter-notebook
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will start a local server, open a browser connecting to this
service, and display the contents of the local directory. Select the
workbook *cosmic-array.ipynb*

Re-run the entire workbook (with the '>>' button) to recalculate the
results and generate the graphs.

* Setup of Jupyter Workbook
** Software Intallation
This software has been run on Ubuntu 19.04 (and previous versions from
17.10)

Download and install the Jupyter Notebook and it's dependancies.

* Tools/Scripts
The following are some examples on how to download data from a Cosmic
Array sensor.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/bash

#CAHOST=10.147.20.58
CAHOST=cosmic-array-2-3

# Rotate data
DATESTAMP=`date +"%Y%m%d"`
ssh pi@$CAHOST mv git/cosmic-array/cosmic-array.log git/cosmic-array.log.$DATESTAMP
ssh pi@$CAHOST reboot

# Get files
scp pi@$CAHOST:git/cosmic-array.log* .
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# To get time from unix timestamp use:
date -d @1515142282

# Combine the files
cat cosmic-array.log.[0-9]* > cosmic-array.log.combined
#+END_EXAMPLE
